                    <p id="description">Scattered across the Xiangkhoang Plateau are thousands of large, carved stone vessels in clusters ranging from one to 100. According to Laotian mythology, the jars were created by a race of giants after a battle victory, and were designed to brew and store rice wine. Researchers believe that the megaliths, placed here as early as 1240 B.C., were used in mortuary rituals, as cremated remains have been found within the vessels, and bones and burial goods have been excavated from areas adjacent to the jars.</p>

                    <p id="description">Since the 1880s, residents of Marfa, Texas, and the surrounding area have been reporting strange lights visible some evenings in a stretch of uninhabited desert south of town. The lights, which can be white, blue, or red, appear out of nowhere, sometimes flickering, hovering, slowly rising, disappearing, then reappearing again. An official viewing zone east of town sees visitors from around the world. Although some scientists have posited that the lights are atmospheric phenomena or car headlights, the mystery remains unsolved.</p>

                    <p id="description">The most architecturally sophisticated prehistoric stone circle in the world, Stonehenge was built over 5,000 years ago and has seen many stages of use, with burial mounds and bones from the site spanning thousands of years. It is estimated that hundreds of cremation burials have taken place at the site, which was possibly used for religious, healing, or astronomical purposes. The entrance is aligned with the rising sun on summer solstice, suggesting it may have also served as a calendar.</p>

                    <p id="description">Like another Magnetic Hill, in New Brunswick, Canada (see above), this section of roadway, surrounded by barren hills, also features an apparently gravity-defying phenomenon, where visitors can park their car in neutral and watch it roll uphill at 12 mph. Some locals claim that the hills have an anomalous magnetic force that is strong enough to move large objects, while others claim that the road leads to heaven and those who are worthy will be pulled there by divine force. A more likely explanation is that the mysterious force is actually an optical illusion caused by the topography of the area – which is also the case in New Brunswick.</p>
