                    <p id="description">The Golden Pheasant is native to central and southern China (it's also known as the Chinese Pheasant)—where the people believe that seeing one indicates good luck and fortune—and features an eye-catching array of colors and patterns. These little guys are omnivores whose diets consist of soft bamboo shoots, insects, berries, seeds, and flowers. They stay relatively small, usually maxing out at 1.2 pounds.Golden Pheasants have the ability to fly but aren't very good at it, which is why they tend to stay grounded unless they need to get back to their roosts.</p>

                    <p id="description">The Tufted Puffin is a surface-diving seabird acclimated to the colder waters of the north Pacific. It's the largest of all the Puffin species and breeds between northwestern Alaska down through central California. The Tufted Puffin's golden plumes only appear during mating season. When this species is ready for nesting, they burrow into the edges of cliffs. Tufted Puffins are skilled hunters who are able to catch and hold up to 20 fish in their mouths at a time in order to bring food back for the chicks. When Tufted Puffins mature and reach adulthood, they eat their fish underwater.</p>

                    <p id="description">Primarily found in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo, Thailand and Myanmar, the helmeted hornbill mostly munches on strangler figs and breeds just once a year, producing a single chick. We'll concede that this large bird looks a smidge like a rooster and a toucan had a lovechild, bringing together standout features like an elongated yellow beak, wrinkly throat patch, and a massive casque at the top of the head, which explains its name. The casque is so large that it actually makes up about 10 percent of the hornbill's weight.</p>

                    <p id="description">The Spectacled Eider gets its name from the markings around its eyes that make it look like it's wearing glasses. This arctic seabird is built to handle cold temperatures and thrives in the tundra, as well as western Alaska, where its main breeding ground lies. The Spectacled Eider's diet consists mostly of mollusks, but when summer rolls around, these birds have been known to munch on grass and berries.</p>

                    <p id="description">The Hoatzin has a distinctive plumage, but an even more distinctive smell, which has given this Amazonian native the nickname “skunk bird.” This is because the bird’s herbivorous diet leaves it digesting leaves and plants like a cow. The smell also seems to repel would-be predators, including humans. The birds’ call also sounds a bit like a crow with a cold. Its place on the bird family tree isn’t well known, as it seems to be its only close relative.</p>
